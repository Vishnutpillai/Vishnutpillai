## 🧩 The Hiring Pipeline (How to Evaluate Me)

Think of this README as a **fast-pass hiring pipeline** 👇  

### 1️⃣ Input: Curiosity + Strong Fundamentals  
I’m a **Data Science fresher** with a strong foundation in:
- Statistics & data analysis  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Real-world, messy datasets (not toy problems)

I enjoy breaking down problems, asking *why* before *how*, and building solutions that actually make sense.

### 2️⃣ Processing Layer: Skills & Tech Stack  

#### 🔹 Core Programming & Data
- **Python**, **SQL**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**

#### 🔹 Visualization & BI
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Power BI**, **Excel**

#### 🔹 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**
- **NLP (Text Processing, Feature Engineering)**
- **Computer Vision (Image-based analysis)**

#### 🔹 Engineering Tools
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **VS Code**
- **Flask (ML-powered web apps)**

> I focus on *why a model works*, not just *how to run it*.

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation: How I Think  

I don’t just build models — I ask:
- Is this **solving the right problem**?
- Can this be **explained to a non-technical stakeholder**?
- Is the solution **scalable and maintainable**?

I value:
- Clean code  
- Reproducibility  
- Clear assumptions  
- Honest model evaluation
